### Please leave a star for the project. This project is free and open source. ‚≠ê You can leave a star from the top right. ‚≠ê‚≠ê

This project is a Spotify listener bot. With this bot, it automatically logs into Spotify web and then opens the Spotify song link it asks you for, pressing the play button. The foundation of the project is Python Selenium.

The project reflects as a listener to you. The project is new and will be supported with updates, but my sole motivation is for you to give the project a star.

The program is new, still in development, please report any bugs to us on the discord server. ‚ö†Ô∏è

# üì• Installation & Usage

### - For the detailed installation pdf, which is the solution to all errors, come to my [discord server](https://discord.gg/AFV9m8UXuT)

- Python must be installed
- If your Python is not installed, download the latest version (3.11) of python and make sure to click on the 'ADD TO PATH' during installation.

- ### Install the chromedriver version compatible with the installed version of Google Chrome on your computer. ‚ö†Ô∏è

  https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/?pli=1
  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kichi779/Spotify-Streaming-Bot/ kichispotify

cd kichispotify

pip install -r requirements.txt (Or you can click on install.bat file)
```
## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

- **After completing the installation process, make sure that you have successfully installed the chromedriver.**

- Type mail:password line by line in the accounts.txt file.

- **Then run the run.bat file or double click the main.py file.**

- **If you are going to use a proxy, write n if not using y.**

- **Enter the Spotify song URL**

- **My advice to you is not to use the keyboard and mouse before all processes are finished. In some places, the program uses the escape key.**


# Usage recommendations üìñ

- This system opens multiple background sites, so make sure you have plenty of RAM or perform this operation on an unused computer. (It could be on a powerful virtual server.)

- Premium accounts give clearer results, new accounts may not generate income for you.

-I do not recommend changing the time sleep settings in the program, it is guaranteed to be slow, I tried to make it behave like a real person

# Stars ‚≠ê
- Proxy system. Each account is connected with a proxy / 150 Star ‚≠ê ‚ùå
